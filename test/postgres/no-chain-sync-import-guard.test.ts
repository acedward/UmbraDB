/**
 * AC-7's automated guard: the real ingestion/sync implementation (node-RPC + indexer-GraphQL
 * client code, `chain-archive-sync/*`, this repo's real full-chain-storage ingestion) lives
 * entirely outside `src/postgres/*` and `src/interfaces/*` -- in fact entirely outside `src/`
 * altogether, the strongest form of that requirement. Mirrors
 * `test/postgres/no-sdk-import-guard.test.ts`'s proven pattern: a WHOLE-FILE source-text scan
 * (not a per-line `/^\s*import\b/` filter, which the existing guard's own F4 fix already
 * demonstrated is bypassable by a re-export).
 *
 * **Sol-audit fix round (Findings 5 + 6) restructure**: the scanning logic is now a real,
 * exported-in-this-file function (`findChainSyncViolations`) that BOTH the production guard
 * tests and the fixture tests invoke -- previously the fixture test only matched a synthetic
 * string against ad-hoc regexes, so it would keep passing even if the actual guard logic broke.
 * The fixture tests now write real temporary `.ts` files containing genuine violating imports
 * and run the SAME walk + scan pipeline the production guard uses over them.
 *
 * **Coverage (Finding 6 strengthening)** -- three independent rules, all of which must stay
 * clean for every `.ts` file under `src/`:
 *   (a) string-literal `from`/`import(...)` specifiers referencing the `chain-archive-sync`
 *       path segment (the original rule -- catches static imports, re-exports, and literal
 *       dynamic `import("...")`);
 *   (b) ANY string literal (single-, double-, or backtick-quoted) containing
 *       `chain-archive-sync` -- catches `require("...")`, `createRequire(...)("...")`, and
 *       computed `import()` where the path sits in one literal (e.g. a template literal), the
 *       realistic computed-import shape this repo itself uses for its sibling-checkout loaders.
 *       Extracted by a real string-aware scanner (comments are NOT string literals, so doc
 *       comments legitimately naming the directory -- which exist under `src/` today -- do not
 *       false-positive, closing the apostrophe-spanning false positive the earlier bare-regex
 *       attempt hit);
 *   (c) the ingestion layer's distinguishing exported class names (`NodeRpcClient`,
 *       `IndexerClient`, `ChainArchiveSyncService`) anywhere in the file -- catches re-exports
 *       and copies under a different path.
 *
 * **Documented residual gaps (Finding 6, explicitly not closed -- statically undetectable
 * without a resolver/type-checker)**: a specifier assembled from SPLIT literals
 * (`"chain-archive-" + "sync"`), an import routed through an external barrel file that itself
 * lives outside `src/` (the barrel would violate nothing under `src/`; catching it needs
 * whole-program import-graph analysis), and fully runtime-constructed specifiers (env vars,
 * user input). Rule (c) still catches any of these the moment the imported class is referenced
 * by name. Note the legitimate computed import that DOES exist in this repo --
   * `chain-archive-sync/tx-replay-decoder.ts`'s ledger loader -- lives outside
 * `src/` and imports the wallet checkout, not `chain-archive-sync`, so it is rightly out of
 * this guard's scope in both dimensions.
