/**
 * Skip-enforcement reconciliation (v1.0.0-recovery-testing, Task 0.4 — `design.md` §1.1).
 *
 * `vitest run` does NOT fail on a skipped / `skipIf` / `todo` test by default, so "the required
 * crash/soak suite does not self-skip" cannot be left to convention — this is the NAMED enforcement
 * mechanism (auditors' BLOCKING-3 / finding 2). It reads Vitest's JSON reporter output and asserts
 * every id in the manifest's `"required"` list was executed AND passed; if any is missing or
 * reported skipped/todo/failed it exits NON-ZERO and NAMES the id. Ids in `"deferred"` are the
 * `WHERE`-gated optional-feature scenarios (e.g. the no-duplicate-on-retry idempotency-key path):
 * they reconcile as `skipped-pending-feature` and are EXEMPT from the must-execute check while
 * their feature is unshipped.
 *
 * Test identity: each governed test embeds its stable id as a `[[id]]` token in its title (which
 * Vitest surfaces verbatim in `assertionResults[].title`/`fullName`). This module extracts those
 * tokens and reconciles them against the manifest. Ids are collision-free by the `[[ ]]` sentinel.
 *
 * Exposed as pure functions (`reconcile`, `extractIds`, `statusesFromReport`) so the behaviour is
 * unit-tested against synthetic reporter payloads (`check-required-tests.test.ts`), and as a CLI
 * (`node --import tsx check-required-tests.ts <report.json> [--manifest <path>]`) wired into
 * `test:conformance` by Task 7.
