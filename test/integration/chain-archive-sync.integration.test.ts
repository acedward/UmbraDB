 * REAL, non-mocked, live end-to-end integration test: a real Postgres (testcontainers) plus a
 * live HTTP connection to an already-running local Midnight devnet (node RPC
 * `http://localhost:9944`, indexer GraphQL `http://localhost:8088/api/v3/graphql`, network id
 * `undeployed1` -- confirmed live via `system_chain` during the original implementation session).
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT gated behind an env-var flag the way `test/integration/
 * preprod-db-sync.integration.test.ts` is (`UMBRADB_LIVE_PREPROD=1`) -- that gate exists because
 * preprod is a shared, funded, real-money-adjacent public network with a seed file that must
 * never be committed; the local devnet used here has none of those constraints.
 *
 * **Devnet-availability gating (Sol-audit fix round, Finding 4)**: when the devnet endpoints are
 * unreachable, this whole suite is `describe.skipIf`-SKIPPED -- reported honestly as skipped in
 * the run summary, exactly like the preprod suite's `describe.skipIf(!LIVE_PREPROD_ENABLED)`
 * precedent. It previously used per-test `if (!up) return;` early-returns, which vitest counts
 * as PASSED, silently inflating the green count in any devnet-less environment. That matters
 * because devnet-less is the NORMAL state in CI: `.github/workflows/conformance.yml` provisions
 * Docker for testcontainers but NO Midnight devnet, so in CI these tests are ALWAYS skipped --
 * a green CI run proves nothing about this file beyond it collecting cleanly. Run it for real
 * with the local devnet up (docs in `design/full-chain-storage-design.md` §3).

   * direct, real-Postgres test in `test/postgres/chain-archive-store.test.ts`. This test now
