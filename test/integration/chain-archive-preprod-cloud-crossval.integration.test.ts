/**
 * AC-8 -- live cross-validation of the full-chain archive against the REAL public Preprod network.
 *
 * AC-8 requires the archive be built by ingesting a contiguous height range from a live,
 * public-testnet-synced node/indexer stack (NOT the local devnet) and cross-validated
 * block-by-block and transaction-by-transaction against values independently queried from the
 * live public network, with any mismatch a HARD failure.
 *
 * The stack here is Midnight's canonical hosted Preprod endpoints
 * (`https://rpc.preprod.midnight.network`, `https://indexer.preprod.midnight.network/api/v4/graphql`)
 * -- the real public network. Gated behind `UMBRADB_LIVE_PREPROD_CLOUD=1`.
 *
 * Ingests a real MULTI-BLOCK contiguous range. (This was previously blocked at block 1 by an
 * over-strict node/indexer containment cross-check in `buildTransactionRecords`, which AC-8
 * surfaced against the real network: from block 1 on, runtime-generated `system-transaction`s
 * -- block rewards -- are not carried as node extrinsics, so the CONTAINS check aborted. The
 * fix scopes that check to `regular` txs only; system txs are stored from the indexer's
 * authoritative raw. This test proves the fix by ingesting past block 1.)
 *
 * ── CI STATUS: DOCUMENTED-MANUAL, pending an owner decision (F7, final-review finding) ───────
 * `UMBRADB_LIVE_PREPROD_CLOUD` is set by NO workflow in this repo, so this suite never executes
 * in CI. Stated explicitly here because silence on that point is what the finding objected to:
 * a reader could otherwise reasonably assume the gate runs somewhere.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT WIRED: this suite hits Midnight's real hosted Preprod endpoints. Putting it on a
 * schedule spends live-network minutes on every run and couples this repo's CI signal to
 * third-party uptime -- a red run would then mean "Preprod was down", not "the archive is
 * wrong", which is the failure mode that trains people to ignore a gate. Whether that trade is
 * worth making, and at what cadence, is a cost decision for the repo owner rather than something
 * this test file can settle. Tracked as an open question in
 * `plans/00002-02-audit-followups.md`; until it is answered, documented-manual is the end state,
 * not a placeholder.
 *
 * HOW TO RUN IT (the manual path this status refers to):
 *
 *   UMBRADB_LIVE_PREPROD_CLOUD=1 \
 *     npx vitest run test/integration/chain-archive-preprod-cloud-crossval.integration.test.ts
 *
 * Optional overrides: `UMBRADB_AC8_MAXBLOCKS` (default 30), `UMBRADB_PREPROD_NODE_URL`,
 * `UMBRADB_PREPROD_INDEXER_URL`.
 *
 * WHAT COVERS THIS IN CI INSTEAD: the local-devnet parity gate in `chain-archive-parity.yml`
 * runs the same block-and-transaction cross-validation shape against a real chain under
 * `REQUIRE_LIVE_SERVICES=1`. It does NOT cover what AC-8 uniquely covers -- a real PUBLIC
 * network, with its own history and its runtime-generated system transactions -- so this is a
 * bound on the exposure, not a replacement.
