/**
 * Content-addressed, chunked persistence for large periodic snapshots (e.g. wallet sync
 * state). `save()` splits `data` into fixed-size chunks, writes each chunk once keyed by its
 * own content hash — chunk storage is a single GLOBAL pool, deduplicating against every prior
 * checkpoint for the same wallet+network and across wallets — then writes an immutable
 * manifest (the ordered chunk-hash list) under the next sequence number.
 *
 * Because chunks are shared across wallets, chunk garbage collection is necessarily global:
 * implementations MUST maintain a per-chunk reference count (or perform a full cross-manifest
 * reference scan) and may physically delete a chunk only when no manifest anywhere in the
 * store references it. The refcount update/scan runs in the same internal transaction as the
 * manifest write or deletion, so a concurrent `save` in another wallet can never resurrect a
 * reference to a chunk mid-reclamation.
 *
 * SECURITY — the global pool is ONE shared trust domain. Because chunk storage is global and
 * content-addressed *across wallets* (above), chunk existence and garbage-collection behavior are
 * OBSERVABLE ACROSS WALLETS: a `save` of bytes already in the pool deduplicates to a metadata-only
 * no-op (a `save`-timing existence oracle), and `prune`'s `reclaimedChunks`/`reclaimedBytes` depend
 * on whether ANOTHER wallet's manifest still references a chunk (a cross-wallet reference-state
 * channel). This is the classic cross-user deduplication side channel; it is only safe when every
 * wallet sharing this store is in a single trust domain — one user's wallet application managing its
 * own wallets, NOT multi-tenancy across mutually-distrusting principals. Placing
 * mutually-distrusting principals on one store is UNSUPPORTED (give each its own store). Full trust
 * model and the fixed-size-chunking bound on the leak: see `SECURITY.md`.
 *
 * Each method is an atomic unit of work. With no `opts.tx`, implementations compose the
 * Transaction/Lease layer internally to make manifest + chunk writes all-or-nothing. `save`
 * additionally accepts an `opts.tx` transaction handle so a caller can compose the checkpoint
 * write into a larger transaction (e.g. co-committing a checkpoint and its sync cursor via
 * `saveAndAdvance`); on that path it issues no `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` of its own and joins the caller's
 * transaction instead. `prune`/`load`/`history` remain internal-transaction-only.
