 * Sprint-fix round Fix 4 (MEDIUM): the chain-archive schema (`src/postgres/migrations/

 * several of its OWN invariants, entirely unrelated to temporal-kv's clock-regression CHECK --
 * before this fix, EVERY `23514` fell through to `ClockRegressionError` below unconditionally,
 * which actively misled anyone debugging a genuine chain-archive data-integrity failure into
 * thinking it was a clock/NTP issue. `translatePostgresError` now branches on the error's own
 * `.constraint_name` (Postgres reports which named constraint fired; see that function's own
 * comment for the full routing table) to tell these apart. Two categories:
 *
 *   - `ChainArchiveInvariantError`: one of chain-archive's own hand-written `RAISE EXCEPTION ...
 *     USING CONSTRAINT = '...'` triggers fired (see the migration's `chain_blob_roles_completeness`/
 *     `blocks_finalized_monotonic`/`chain_blob_roles_removal_guard` constraint names) -- a
 *     malformed blob-role write, or a genuine attempt to un-finalize a previously-finalized
 *     block. These are cross-write invariants a plain CHECK constraint cannot express on its own,
 *     which is why they're triggers rather than CHECKs in the first place.
 *   - `ChainArchiveCheckViolationError`: an ordinary table `CHECK` constraint on one of
 *     chain-archive's own tables fired (status/kind enum values, hash-length checks, nonnegative
 *     checks, the `(scope = 'contract') = (contract_address IS NOT NULL)` tie, etc.) --
 *     recognized by the constraint name's table-name prefix (Postgres auto-names an unlabeled
 *     CHECK `<table>_<column>_check` or `<table>_check[N]`, confirmed empirically against a real
 *     Postgres 17 instance while implementing this fix).
