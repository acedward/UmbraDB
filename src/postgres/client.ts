 * `src/interfaces/temporal-kv.ts`'s `StoredVersionSchema`.
 *
 * **Revised after a cross-vendor audit found the chosen schema wasn't actually threaded
 * anywhere a caller could read it back.** `PgTemporalKV` (and any future adapter module) takes
 * its own, independently-defaulted `schema` constructor parameter — nothing previously
 * connected "the schema `createClient` was configured with" to "the schema an adapter
 * constructed from that client's `Sql` instance defaults to," so `createClient({schema:
 * "tenant_a"})` followed by `new PgTemporalKV(sql)` (without ALSO re-passing `"tenant_a"` as a
 * second constructor argument) would silently query `"umbradb"` instead — two independent
 * defaults that only agreed by accident. Fix: attach the resolved schema onto the returned
 * `Sql` instance itself (as `umbradbSchema`, a plain non-enumerable property — `postgres.js`'s
 * `sql` value is a callable function, and functions are ordinary objects that can carry extra
 * properties) so it becomes the ONE place this information lives; every adapter's constructor
 * defaults its own `schema` parameter to `sql.umbradbSchema` instead of a separate literal.
