 * G6 — Durability startup probe + transaction-pooler detection

 *
 * `createClient` is synchronous, but a `SHOW`/`current_setting`-and-verify probe is inherently
 * async, so the probe is this exported async function rather than folded into `createClient`. It is
 * wired as a MANDATORY step of `runMigrations` (`migrate.ts`) so the crash-safety precondition is
 * enforced, not left to caller discipline (design.md §2.1) — a hard violation makes `runMigrations`
 * reject before any migration runs. `probeDurability` also remains directly callable.
 *
 * SQL discipline: the probe interpolates NO identifier or value into SQL. Settings are read via
 * `current_setting($1)` (the name is a bind parameter, equivalent to `SHOW <name>`, verified against
 * PostgreSQL 17), and the pooler check uses parameterized `pg_try_advisory_lock`/`pg_locks`. There
 * is no `sql.unsafe()` site here — the frozen-surface allowlist is unchanged.
