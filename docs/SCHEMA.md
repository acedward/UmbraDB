# UmbraDB Postgres Schema Reference

UmbraDB is a Postgres storage layer for the Midnight Network. Its core architectural rule is
that `src/postgres/*` (and `src/interfaces/*`) must never import the Midnight wallet SDK, and
must never depend on the indexer or any chain-sync/ingestion code — those are separate concerns
that live outside `src/` entirely. This is not just a convention: it is checked by automated
guard tests on every run (see [Boundary enforcement](#boundary-enforcement) below). Everything
described in this document is schema and storage-adapter code; no file discussed here talks to
a node, an indexer, or a wallet SDK type at runtime.

The database holds **two independent schema lineages**, each with its own migration history and
its own `<schema>._migrations` bookkeeping table:

| Lineage | Schema (conventional name) | Migrations | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **tier1_wallet** | `tier1_wallet` | `src/postgres/migrations/000_schema.ts` … `006_ckpt_chunks_size_bytes.ts` | `000`–`004` merged to `main`, in production use; `005_kv_current_fillfactor` + `006_ckpt_chunks_size_bytes` added by the `v1.0.0-perf-baseline` change |
| **chain_archive** ("Tier-1.5") | `chain_archive` | `src/postgres/migrations/chain_archive/001_chain_archive_core.ts` … `007_blob_role_guard_forward_fix.ts` | Implemented on `feat/indexer-independent-ingest` (PR #1), pending merge |

> **Provenance note on `chain_archive` (updated 2026-08-15).** The original core schema came from
> the audited `feature/full-chain-storage-implementation` lineage. The current shape is migrations
> 001–007 on `feat/indexer-independent-ingest`: position-keyed transactions, persisted runtime

Both lineages are designed to live in **one Postgres instance, two (or more) schemas** — not a
merged schema, and specifically not merged into the official Midnight indexer's own forked
Postgres schema (which the project's design docs refer to as "Tier 2"). `chain_archive` is
"Tier-1.5": distinct from `tier1_wallet` (client wallet/checkpoint persistence) and distinct from
the Tier-2 indexer fork.

## tier1_wallet lineage

Source: `src/postgres/migrations/000_schema.ts` – `006_ckpt_chunks_size_bytes.ts`, plus the runtime
adapters `src/postgres/temporal-kv.ts`, `src/postgres/checkpoint-store.ts`,
`src/postgres/watermarks.ts`, `src/postgres/transaction-history-storage.ts`,
`src/postgres/wallet-state-envelope.ts`.

Every migration in this lineage is schema-qualified via `sql(schema)` (identifier-escaped, never
a hardcoded literal), so the same DDL can be applied under any schema name the caller chooses —
`tier1_wallet` is the convention, not a hardcoded requirement. `000_schema.ts` creates the schema
itself plus a `_migrations(name text primary key, applied_at timestamptz)` bookkeeping table;
`runMigrations` (`src/postgres/migrate.ts`) only calls it when
`to_regclass('<schema>._migrations')` is `NULL`, and applies the rest of the lineage in numeric
order inside a schema-scoped Postgres advisory lock so two application instances starting
concurrently cannot double-apply a migration.

### `kv_current` / `kv_history` — TemporalKV

**Purpose.** A generic, namespaced, versioned JSONB key/value store with point-in-time history —
the general-purpose storage primitive most other wallet state is (or could be) built on. "Current"
values live in one table; every value a key has ever held lives in a second, append-only table.
This is what makes it *temporal*: a `getAt({at: someDate})` or `getAt({at: {kind:"version", ...}})`
call can reconstruct the value a key held at any past instant or version, not just its latest
value.

**`kv_current`** (migration `001_temporal_kv`):

```sql
CREATE TABLE kv_current (
  ns           text NOT NULL,
  scope        text NOT NULL,
  key          text NOT NULL,
  value        jsonb NOT NULL,
  version      bigint NOT NULL,
  updated_at   timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT date_trunc('milliseconds', clock_timestamp()),
  updated_xact bigint NOT NULL DEFAULT txid_current(),
  PRIMARY KEY (ns, scope, key)
)
```

- `(ns, scope, key)` is the full addressing tuple — a namespace, a scope within it, and a key.
- `updated_at` is truncated to **millisecond** precision at write time (`date_trunc('milliseconds',
  clock_timestamp())`), not left at Postgres's native microsecond precision. Reasoning: JS `Date`
  only carries millisecond precision, so a `getAt({at})` call round-trips a `Date` the caller read
  back from a prior write; without truncation the reconstructed instant is silently *earlier* than
  the true microsecond-precision `valid_from`, causing point-in-time lookups to miss the row
  entirely. The one accepted cost: two writes to the *same* key in different transactions landing
  in the same millisecond now collide and raise a `ClockRegressionError` (SQLSTATE `23514`) rather
  than silently succeeding with an ambiguous timestamp — documented as a formal caveat on the
  temporal algebra's "Law T4" rather than silently accepted.
- `updated_xact` (via `txid_current()`) backs a hard invariant enforced by the history trigger
  below: **only one write per key per transaction is allowed.** Postgres's `now()` is fixed at
  transaction start (not per-statement or commit time), so a second same-transaction write to the
  same key would otherwise produce a `kv_history` row whose `valid_from = valid_to`, silently
  losing that intermediate version. Rather than redesign history retention to tolerate that, the
  trigger raises `ERRCODE = 'UB001'` if `OLD.updated_xact = txid_current()` — a deliberate
  "forbid, don't paper over" design choice.

**`kv_history`** (migration `001_temporal_kv`):

```sql
CREATE TABLE kv_history (
  id         bigserial PRIMARY KEY,
  ns         text NOT NULL,
  scope      text NOT NULL,
  key        text NOT NULL,
  value      jsonb NOT NULL,
  version    bigint NOT NULL,
  valid_from timestamptz NOT NULL,
  valid_to   timestamptz NOT NULL,
  validity   tstzrange GENERATED ALWAYS AS (tstzrange(valid_from, valid_to, '[)')) STORED,
  CONSTRAINT kv_history_range CHECK (valid_from < valid_to),
  CONSTRAINT kv_history_no_overlap EXCLUDE USING gist (
    ns WITH =, scope WITH =, key WITH =, validity WITH &&
  )
);
CREATE INDEX kv_history_lookup    ON kv_history (ns, scope, key, valid_from);
CREATE INDEX kv_history_by_version ON kv_history (ns, scope, key, version);
```

- `validity` is a **generated, stored** half-open range (`[valid_from, valid_to)`), which is what
  lets `getAt({at})` use a single `validity @> $timestamp` containment lookup instead of a
  two-sided comparison.
- `kv_history_no_overlap` is a Postgres `EXCLUDE USING gist` constraint (requires the `btree_gist`
  extension, installed by this migration under a dedicated `pg_advisory_xact_lock(3, 0)` to avoid
  a real, empirically-confirmed `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS` catalog race between concurrently
  migrating schemas): it makes it structurally impossible for two `kv_history` rows for the same
  `(ns, scope, key)` to have overlapping validity intervals. This is the database-level half of
  the "at most one row can ever match a given instant" invariant history retention depends on.
- The trigger `kv_current_history_trigger` (fired `BEFORE UPDATE` on `kv_current` as
  `kv_current_history_bu`) is what actually populates `kv_history`: on every update it inserts the
  *old* row into `kv_history` with `valid_to` set to the new write's timestamp, then lets the
  update to `kv_current` proceed with the new `updated_at`/`updated_xact`. History is never written
  directly by application code — it is entirely a side effect of updating `kv_current`.
- **Retention is unbounded** by this migration — Sprint 1 (the migration that introduced this
  table) deliberately performs no pruning; every version a key has ever held remains in
  `kv_history` forever, by design (the interface's `HistoryUnavailableError`/retention-floor
  machinery exists for a future sprint to wire in, but nothing in the current implementation can
  throw it).
- `getAt` unions `kv_history` and `kv_current` (tagged with a `priority` column, `kv_history`
  first) rather than assuming `kv_history` alone is sufficient — defense-in-depth against a
  scenario where a manual/backfilled `kv_history` row's interval improperly overlaps the live
  `kv_current` row's instant; without ordering, an unordered `LIMIT 1` over the union would return
  an implementation-defined row instead of a deterministic one.

**Write-path invariants (`src/postgres/temporal-kv.ts`, `PgTemporalKV.put`):**

- No `expectedVersion`: unconditional upsert via `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (ns, scope, key) DO
  UPDATE SET value = EXCLUDED.value, version = kv_current.version + 1`.
- `expectedVersion === 0n`: "must not already exist" — `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, and if
  zero rows come back, the key already existed, so the row is re-read and a `VersionConflictError`
  raised reporting the real current version. A plain guarded `UPDATE` cannot express "insert only
  if absent," which is why this is a distinct code path.
- A specific `expectedVersion`: a compare-and-swap `UPDATE ... WHERE ... AND version =
  expectedVersion`. Zero rows affected is ambiguous between "version conflict" and "key never
  written" — the implementation re-reads to distinguish the two and reports which one actually
  happened.

### CheckpointStore tables

**Purpose.** Content-addressed, chunked binary blob storage with manifests, used to persist
arbitrary wallet-state snapshots ("checkpoints") without storing a full copy of every checkpoint's
bytes — chunks are deduplicated globally by SHA-256 content hash, and a manifest is just an
ordered list of chunk references plus a hash over that ordered list.

**`ckpt_chunks`** (migration `002_checkpoint_store`):

```sql
-- 002_checkpoint_store creates the table; 006_ckpt_chunks_size_bytes later adds size_bytes.
CREATE TABLE ckpt_chunks (
  hash       bytea PRIMARY KEY,
  data       bytea NOT NULL,
  size_bytes integer GENERATED ALWAYS AS (octet_length(data)) STORED,  -- added by migration 006
  created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
)
```

- `hash` is the SHA-256 (32 bytes) of `data`, computed application-side (`checkpoint-store.ts`'s
  `sha256()`) rather than by a generated column — it is the content address `save()`'s chunker
  emits, and `load()` re-verifies it against the fetched bytes.
- `size_bytes integer GENERATED ALWAYS AS (octet_length(data)) STORED` is a stored generated column
  **added by migration `006_ckpt_chunks_size_bytes`** (IS-2, `v1.0.0-perf-baseline`), matching the
  `chain_archive.chain_blobs` pattern. `history()`'s aggregate sums this stored column so it never
  detoasts the `data` bytea just to length it (HP-2); the `GENERATED … STORED` expression backfills
  existing rows at migration time and is computed for all future inserts, so it never drifts from
  `data`.
- Content-addressed and globally deduplicated: `save()` splits the caller's payload into
  `DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE = 4 MiB` chunks (configurable per-save via `opts.chunkSize`), hashes each,
  and upserts every chunk with `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (hash) DO UPDATE SET created_at = now()` — a
  chunk shared by two different checkpoints (or even reused twice within one checkpoint) is stored
  exactly once. The `created_at` refresh on conflict is **load-bearing**, not cosmetic: it is what
  keeps a still-referenced chunk outside `prune()`'s grace-window reclaim query (below).
- Chunk storage is a single **global, cross-wallet** pool — not scoped to `(walletId, networkId)`.

**`ckpt_manifests`** (migration `002_checkpoint_store`):

```sql
CREATE TABLE ckpt_manifests (
  id            bigserial PRIMARY KEY,
  w             text NOT NULL,
  net           text NOT NULL,
  seq           bigint NOT NULL,
  complete      boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  manifest_hash bytea NOT NULL,
  label         text,
  created_at    timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
CREATE INDEX ckpt_manifests_lookup ON ckpt_manifests (w, net, complete, seq DESC);
```

- One row per saved checkpoint, keyed logically by `(w, net, seq)` (wallet id, network id, and a
  per-`(w,net)` sequence number — see `ckpt_sequence_counters` below).
- `manifest_hash` is a SHA-256 over the **position-ordered** sequence of chunk hashes, computed
  once at `save()` time (`sha256(Buffer.concat(chunkHashes))`) so `load()`/`history()` never need
  to recompute it from the junction table just to report it — but `load()` *does* recompute it
  from the actually-fetched chunks and compares, as an integrity check (see below).
- `complete` is written explicitly as `true` on every real save — never left at its schema
  `DEFAULT false` — because every read path (`load`, `history`, `prune`) filters on `complete`; a
  caller that omitted it would see every subsequent read silently return nothing.
- The `ckpt_manifests_lookup` index is shaped for the actual access pattern: filter by
  `(w, net, complete)`, then walk `seq` in descending order (both `load()`'s "latest" case and
  `history()`'s paginated listing).

**`ckpt_manifest_chunks`** (migration `002_checkpoint_store`) — the manifest→chunk junction table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE ckpt_manifest_chunks (
  manifest_id bigint  NOT NULL REFERENCES ckpt_manifests(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  position    integer NOT NULL,
  chunk_hash  bytea   NOT NULL REFERENCES ckpt_chunks(hash),
  PRIMARY KEY (manifest_id, position)
);
CREATE INDEX ckpt_manifest_chunks_by_hash ON ckpt_manifest_chunks (chunk_hash);
```

- Keyed on `(manifest_id, position)`, **not** `(manifest_id, chunk_hash)` — a manifest referencing
  the same chunk hash at two different positions (a real repeated-content-run payload) would
  otherwise silently lose bytes on reconstruction, since `(manifest_id, chunk_hash)` alone cannot
  represent that. `chunk_hash` is a plain FK column here, not part of the primary key.
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` on `manifest_id`: without it, `prune()`'s manifest `DELETE` would raise a
  foreign-key violation for *every* manifest that still has junction rows referencing it — i.e.
  every manifest ever saved, since junction rows are never deleted independently — so garbage
  collection could never delete a single manifest. Cascading removes the junction rows in the same
  statement as the manifest delete, which is also what makes them invisible to the chunk-reclaim
  query's `NOT EXISTS` check in the same GC pass.

**`ckpt_sequence_counters`** (migration `002_checkpoint_store`) — the per-`(w, net)` sequence
allocator:

```sql
CREATE TABLE ckpt_sequence_counters (
  w        text   NOT NULL,
  net      text   NOT NULL,
  next_seq bigint NOT NULL DEFAULT 2,
  PRIMARY KEY (w, net)
)
```

- `save()` allocates a sequence number atomically via `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (w, net) DO UPDATE
  SET next_seq = next_seq + 1 RETURNING next_seq - 1 AS claimed_seq`, inside the same transaction
  as the rest of the save — gapless and monotonic under concurrency purely because the row lock
  taken by the upsert is held for the whole transaction. `next_seq DEFAULT 2` exists so the very
  first claim for a fresh `(w, net)` pair (the `INSERT` branch of the upsert) reports `next_seq - 1
  = 1`, matching the documented "sequences start at 1" contract.

**Read-path integrity checks (`checkpoint-store.ts`, `load()`):** runs inside a `REPEATABLE READ`
transaction (both the manifest lookup and the chunk-join query observe one consistent snapshot,
immune to a concurrently-committing `prune()`'s cascade removing junction rows between the two
statements), then for every chunk: (1) asserts positions are dense `0..n-1` (structurally
impossible to violate on any `save()` path — a defense-in-depth assertion against out-of-band
corruption); (2) if the `LEFT JOIN` to `ckpt_chunks` found no row, raises `ChunkMissingError`; (3)
recomputes each chunk's SHA-256 and compares to `ckpt_manifest_chunks.chunk_hash`, raising
`ChunkIntegrityError` on mismatch; (4) after reassembly, recomputes the **manifest** hash over the
actually-fetched chunk sequence and compares it to `ckpt_manifests.manifest_hash`, raising
`ManifestCorruptError` on mismatch — this catches a junction-row substitution attack that the
per-chunk check alone cannot (every individual chunk valid, positions dense, but the overall
sequence no longer matches what `save()` actually wrote).

**Prune / GC (`prune()`):** runs at Postgres's default `READ COMMITTED` isolation (a stated
dependency, not an oversight — the grace-window race-safety argument below relies on
`READ COMMITTED`'s per-row re-evaluation). Two steps in one transaction: (1) delete manifests past
`retainCount`, cascading their junction rows; (2) reclaim chunks with `created_at < now() -
interval '15 minutes'` (a hardcoded, trusted literal — Postgres's interval-literal grammar wants a
literal here, not a bind parameter) that no surviving junction row references. The 15-minute grace
window plus the `created_at` refresh on every chunk write together close a TOCTOU race: a chunk
referenced by an in-flight `save()` that hasn't yet inserted its junction rows cannot be reclaimed
out from under it, because its `created_at` was just refreshed.

### `watermarks`

**Purpose.** A generic `(kind, key) -> jsonb value` cursor/progress table — e.g. "how far has sync
progressed" — with no history, no versioning, and no temporal semantics; the simplest table in the
lineage.

```sql
CREATE TABLE watermarks (
  kind       text NOT NULL,
  key        text NOT NULL,
  value      jsonb NOT NULL,
  updated_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  PRIMARY KEY (kind, key)
) WITH (fillfactor = 90)
```

- `fillfactor = 90` is a deliberate physical-storage choice, not a default: this table is expected
  to be updated on every sync tick (few distinct rows, extremely high per-row update frequency) —
  exactly the workload Postgres's HOT (Heap-Only Tuple) update optimization exists for, and the
  default `fillfactor = 100` leaves no per-page slack for an updated row to be rewritten on the
  same page. **Hard invariant documented in the migration itself: never add an index on `value` or
  `updated_at`** — either would break HOT eligibility for every write to this table.
- `updated_at` uses `now()` (transaction-start time), not `clock_timestamp()` — unlike `kv_current`,
  nothing in this table's contract depends on `updated_at` for ordering; it is diagnostic only, so
  the two-same-transaction-writes-collapse-to-one-timestamp behavior of `now()` is harmless here.
- `PgWatermarks.set()` explicitly rejects a top-level JSON `null` value at the application layer
  (not via the Zod schema, which structurally permits it) — `value jsonb NOT NULL` only forbids a
  SQL `NULL` in the column, but the Postgres driver would otherwise write the wire-protocol NULL
  marker for a JS `null` parameter regardless of the column's declared type, hitting a raw
  `23502 not_null_violation` instead of a clean validation error.
- `get()` never throws for a missing key — it returns `undefined`. This is the one method in the
  whole tier1_wallet storage layer where absence needs no further distinction (no retention window,
  no reachability concern, unlike `kv_history`'s `HistoryUnavailableError` machinery).

### `transaction_history`

**Purpose.** Per-wallet transaction history with lifecycle tracking (`pending` → `finalized` /
`rejected`) and an identifier-subset "supersession" rule: finalizing/rejecting a transaction clears
any other still-pending entries whose identifiers are a subset of the finalized one's.

```sql
CREATE TABLE transaction_history (
  wallet_id   text        NOT NULL,
  tx_hash     text        NOT NULL,
  entry       jsonb       NOT NULL,
  identifiers text[]      NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
  lifecycle   text        NOT NULL,
  updated_at  timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  PRIMARY KEY (wallet_id, tx_hash)
);
CREATE INDEX transaction_history_identifiers_gin ON transaction_history USING gin (identifiers);
```

- `identifiers` and `lifecycle` are **denormalized out of `entry`** rather than living only inside
  the JSONB, specifically so the identifier-subset pending-clear rule can be checked with a
  GIN-indexed containment query (`identifiers <@ ...`) instead of a JSONB path scan on every
  finalize/reject write, and so a caller can filter by lifecycle without unpacking `entry`. Both
  columns are always written in the same statement as `entry`, so they can never drift out of sync
  with it. `lifecycle` stores only the discriminant (`entry.lifecycle.status`); the full lifecycle
  object (room for per-status detail) lives in `entry` itself.
- `entry` stores a full JSONB snapshot of the logical entry, with `bigint`/`Date` values
  (e.g. `fees`, `timestamp`) tagged through a reserved-key encoding (`__ths_bigint`/`__ths_date`
  style tags, built from the same `THS_RESERVED_KEY_PREFIX` the write-side Zod schema rejects any
  caller key under, so the tag namespace cannot collide with real caller data) rather than stored
  as native JSON numbers/strings, since JSON has no native bigint or Date type and a bare numeric
  `fees` value would lose precision or silently coerce.
- **Concurrency / merge invariant** (`transaction-history-storage.ts`, `writeRows`): every write
  acquires `pg_advisory_xact_lock(4, hashtext(walletId || ':' || txHash))` **before** the
  `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` read of any existing row — necessary because a bare `SELECT ... FOR
  UPDATE` cannot lock a row that doesn't exist yet, so two concurrent first-ever writes to the same
  `(walletId, hash)` would both read "no existing row" and race an upsert without ever seeing each
  other's data, silently losing one write's `sections`. The advisory lock closes that gap by
  serializing every writer for a given hash regardless of whether a row already exists yet.
- The actual section-merge/identifier-union/lifecycle-resolution logic is **entirely delegated** to
  a caller-injected `MergeEntriesFn` — this table's own code only does locking, persisting the
  merge result, and the identifier-subset pending-clear `DELETE`. This keeps the storage layer free
  of any wallet-SDK-shaped merge semantics (the injected function is production-configured to
  mirror the real SDK's `mergeWalletEntries` behavior, but this class has no compile- or run-time
  dependency on the SDK itself).
- The pending-clear `DELETE` only runs when the write's own status is `finalized`/`rejected` *and*
  its identifier set is non-empty — an empty identifier set is vacuously "a subset of" anything,
  which would otherwise clear every unrelated pending entry the moment any hash finalizes with zero
  identifiers.

### Wallet State Envelope

`PgWalletStateEnvelopeStore` (`src/postgres/wallet-state-envelope.ts`) adds **no new table and no
new migration**. It is a thin wrapper over an injected `CheckpointStore` that encodes a
`WalletStateEnvelope` (a bundle of three opaque sub-wallet strings) to bytes and persists it via a
single `CheckpointStore.save(walletId, networkId, bytes)` call, so all three sub-wallets become
durable atomically as one checkpoint — reusing `ckpt_chunks`/`ckpt_manifests`/
`ckpt_manifest_chunks`/`ckpt_sequence_counters` entirely rather than duplicating storage. It
cross-checks the envelope's own echoed `(walletId, networkId)` against the requested key on both
`save` (rejecting a mismatch before any encode/persist work happens) and `load` (raising
`EnvelopeCorruptError` on mismatch), so a caller cannot silently persist an envelope under one key
while its embedded identity claims another.

## chain_archive lineage

Source (see the [provenance note](#chain_archive-lineage) above for which branch this reflects):
`src/postgres/migrations/chain_archive/001_chain_archive_core.ts` through
`007_blob_role_guard_forward_fix.ts`,
`src/postgres/migrations/chain_archive/index.ts` (the `chainArchiveMigrations` lineage array),
`src/postgres/migrations/chain_archive/partition-config.ts` (partition sizing constants),
`src/interfaces/chain-archive-store.ts` (the storage contract),
`src/postgres/chain-archive-store.ts` (the Postgres implementation),
`src/postgres/chain-archive-rollover.ts` (the partition-rollover runbook implementation).

**Purpose of the lineage as a whole:** full-chain archival storage — blocks, ordered transactions,
bridge observations, verifier-key sightings, runtime metadata and ledger replay checkpoints —
independent of and resilient to an indexer wipe/rebuild. The store models a full block tree. The
production sync writer deliberately ingests only finalized canonical blocks; general best-tail
reorg writing is outside that writer's contract.

### `chain_blobs` / `chain_blob_roles`

**`chain_blobs`** — the content-addressed blob pool, sibling in spirit to tier1_wallet's
`ckpt_chunks`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE chain_blobs (
  hash       bytea PRIMARY KEY CHECK (octet_length(hash) = 32),
  data       bytea NOT NULL,
  size_bytes integer GENERATED ALWAYS AS (octet_length(data)) STORED,
  created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
)
```

- `hash` is a SHA-256 (enforced to be exactly 32 bytes via `CHECK`), computed by the storage
  adapter itself (never trusted from a caller-supplied value) — `putBlobWithRole`/`insertBlockRow`/
  etc. always call `sha256Hex()` on the actual bytes before writing.
- `size_bytes` is a **generated column** (`octet_length(data)`), not a caller-supplied value that
  could silently disagree with the real byte length — a correction from an earlier design pass.
- Every blob write is `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (hash) DO NOTHING` — a byte-identical blob reused
  across multiple logical roles (e.g. the same bytes serving as both a block header in one context
  and something else in another) is stored exactly once, matching `chain_blobs`'s single global
  content-addressed pool design.

**`chain_blob_roles`** — a many-to-many role-classification table, **not** a single-valued `kind`
column on `chain_blobs` itself:

```sql
CREATE TABLE chain_blob_roles (
  blob_hash bytea NOT NULL REFERENCES chain_blobs(hash),
  role      text  NOT NULL CHECK (role IN
    ('block_header', 'block_body', 'tx_raw', 'proof', 'verifier_key', 'bridge_observation')),
  PRIMARY KEY (blob_hash, role)
);
CREATE INDEX chain_blob_roles_by_role ON chain_blob_roles (role);
```

Why a junction table instead of a single `kind` enum column: identical bytes can legitimately serve
more than one logical role (deduplicating that collision is correct, not a bug), which contradicts
storing one required, single-valued classification per row.

**Blob-role completeness is DB-enforced, not just conventional.** Every table that references
`chain_blobs(hash)` — `blocks.header_blob_hash`/`body_blob_hash`, `transactions.raw_blob_hash`,
`bridge_observations.raw_blob_hash`, `verifier_key_observations.vk_hash` — has a
`BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE` trigger calling a shared helper function,
`chain_archive_assert_blob_role(blob_hash, role, table, column)`, which raises
`ERRCODE = 23514` (tagged `CONSTRAINT = 'chain_blob_roles_completeness'` so the shared error
translator can distinguish it from unrelated `23514`s elsewhere in the schema) if no matching
`chain_blob_roles` row exists for that `(blob_hash, role)` pair. This closes the gap where a
consumer could reference an unclassified blob.

The **delete/update side is symmetrically guarded**: `chain_blob_roles_guard_removal_trigger`
(`BEFORE DELETE OR UPDATE OF blob_hash, role` on `chain_blob_roles` itself) rejects
removing/repointing a role row still relied on by a live row in whichever table consumes that
role, checked via `chain_archive_assert_role_removable`. Without this, a role row could be deleted
out from under an already-passing reference, silently leaving it pointing at an unclassified blob.
Concurrency between the insert-side check (`FOR SHARE` on the specific `(blob_hash, role)` row) and
the delete-side check (`FOR UPDATE` on the same row) is closed by ordinary Postgres row-lock
semantics: whichever side acquires the lock first forces the other to wait and then re-evaluate
against post-commit state, so it is structurally impossible to end up with a live reference to a
removed role. This was empirically verified against a real Postgres 17 instance with two genuinely
concurrent sessions, in both lock-acquisition orderings.

Both triggers are defined once on the table (a plain table for `chain_blob_roles`, or the
partitioned parent for `blocks`/`transactions`/`bridge_observations`) and are automatically cloned
onto every partition, present and future — standard PostgreSQL 11+ row-trigger propagation on
partitioned tables.

### `blocks`

The block **tree**, not just the canonical chain — competing blocks at the same height are both
legitimately storable, which is what makes the primary key shape below load-bearing.

```sql
CREATE TABLE blocks (
  net              text        NOT NULL,
  block_hash       bytea       NOT NULL CHECK (octet_length(block_hash) = 32),
  height           bigint      NOT NULL CHECK (height >= 0),
  parent_hash      bytea       NOT NULL CHECK (octet_length(parent_hash) = 32),
  state_root       bytea       NOT NULL CHECK (octet_length(state_root) = 32),
  extrinsics_root  bytea       NOT NULL CHECK (octet_length(extrinsics_root) = 32),
  author           bytea,
  header_blob_hash bytea       NOT NULL REFERENCES chain_blobs(hash),
  body_blob_hash   bytea       REFERENCES chain_blobs(hash),
  is_canonical     boolean     NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  status           text        NOT NULL DEFAULT 'seen'
                     CHECK (status IN ('seen', 'canonical', 'orphaned', 'pruned')),
  finalized        boolean     NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  synced_at        timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  CHECK ((status = 'canonical') = is_canonical),
  CHECK (NOT finalized OR is_canonical),
  PRIMARY KEY (net, height, block_hash)
) PARTITION BY RANGE (height)
```

- **`net` in the primary key**: nothing before this design revision stopped two different
  networks' archive data from being silently comingled in one archive table; `net` was folded into
  the PK alongside `height` (the partition key) and `block_hash`.
- **`body_blob_hash` is nullable at the storage-contract level** for callers that only possess a
  header. The production sync service always supplies the canonical JSON-encoded block body.
- **`parent_hash` deliberately has no foreign key** back to another `blocks` row: a
  self-referencing FK across range partitions complicates out-of-order reorg backfill;
  parent-link integrity is treated as an application-level invariant instead.
- **Canonical-uniqueness enforcement**, two parts working together:
  - `CHECK ((status = 'canonical') = is_canonical)` ties the two flags together at every write.
  - A **partial unique index**, `blocks_one_canonical_per_height ON blocks (net, height) WHERE
    is_canonical`, enforces at most one canonical block per `(net, height)` globally. This works
    on a `PARTITION BY RANGE (height)` table specifically *because* the index includes the
    partition key column (`height`): Postgres implements it as one native partitioned index with a
    matching valid child index on every partition, and since `height` is the partition key, two
    rows sharing the same `height` can only ever land in the same physical partition — so
    per-partition local enforcement genuinely is global enforcement for this key. (Empirically
    verified: Postgres unconditionally rejects a partial unique index on a partitioned table that
    *omits* the partition key column, confirming this isn't incidental.)
- **Finalized/canonical monotonicity**, also two parts:
  - `CHECK (NOT finalized OR is_canonical)` — a finalized block is always canonical (real
    Substrate/GRANDPA finality semantics); this ties the two flags together at each individual
    write.
  - `blocks_finalized_monotonic_trigger` (`BEFORE UPDATE OF finalized`) additionally rejects the
    transition `OLD.finalized = true AND NEW.finalized = false` — GRANDPA finality is monotonic by
    construction (a finalized block never becomes un-finalized), and the `CHECK` alone only
    constrains each write in isolation, not transitions across writes. Raises `23514` tagged
    `CONSTRAINT = 'blocks_finalized_monotonic'`.
- Supporting indexes: `blocks_by_hash (block_hash)`, `blocks_by_parent (parent_hash)`.
- Partitioned by `RANGE (height)` — see [Partition rollover design](#partition-rollover-design).

### `transactions` (chain_archive)

Metadata only — raw transaction bytes are stored via a blob reference, matching the
metadata/blob split used throughout this lineage.

```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
  net              text        NOT NULL,
  tx_hash          bytea       NOT NULL CHECK (octet_length(tx_hash) = 32),
  block_height     bigint      NOT NULL CHECK (block_height >= 0),
  block_hash       bytea       NOT NULL CHECK (octet_length(block_hash) = 32),
  position         integer     NOT NULL CHECK (position >= 0),
  kind             text        NOT NULL CHECK (kind IN ('regular', 'system')),
  protocol_version integer     NOT NULL CHECK (protocol_version >= 0),
  result           text        CHECK (result IN ('success', 'partial_success', 'failure')
                                       OR result IS NULL),
  raw_blob_hash    bytea       NOT NULL REFERENCES chain_blobs(hash),
  synced_at        timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  PRIMARY KEY (net, block_height, block_hash, position),
  FOREIGN KEY (net, block_height, block_hash) REFERENCES blocks (net, height, block_hash)
) PARTITION BY RANGE (block_height)
```

- **Migration 002 promotes position to the primary key.** The final key is
  `(net, block_height, block_hash, position)`, so two rows at one slot are impossible while two
  legitimate reference-indexer rows sharing a transaction hash can coexist. `tx_hash` remains an
  ordinary indexed lookup value, not a uniqueness claim.
- A real foreign key back to `blocks (net, height, block_hash)` rejects both a reference to a
  nonexistent block and a reference whose `block_height`/`block_hash` don't jointly match a real
  `blocks` row — this works across two independently range-partitioned tables because both are
  partitioned on columns in the same domain (`block_height` here, `height` on `blocks`).
- `transactions_by_hash (tx_hash)` is kept as a genuinely distinct index (not a left-prefix of the
  PK). A `(net, block_height, block_hash)` index was deliberately **not** created — it is a
  strict left-prefix of the PK's own backing btree index, so it buys no distinct access pattern
  and only adds write amplification.
- Partitioned by `RANGE (block_height)`.

### `bridge_observations`

Metadata + blob-reference table for cross-chain bridge/governance observations (e.g. `cNight`
registrations, D-parameter/system-parameter updates). These are carried in Substrate **inherents**
(block body data), which is why this data cannot be reliably reconstructed from `transactions`
alone or deferred until full block-body sync exists — the table stands on its own, referencing its
own raw bytes independent of whether `blocks.body_blob_hash` is populated.

```sql
CREATE TABLE bridge_observations (
  net               text        NOT NULL,
  block_height      bigint      NOT NULL CHECK (block_height >= 0),
  block_hash        bytea       NOT NULL CHECK (octet_length(block_hash) = 32),
  observation_index integer     NOT NULL CHECK (observation_index >= 0),
  kind              text        NOT NULL CHECK (kind IN
    ('cnight_registration', 'system_parameters_d', 'spo_registration', 'other')),
  raw_blob_hash     bytea       NOT NULL REFERENCES chain_blobs(hash),
  synced_at         timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  PRIMARY KEY (net, block_height, block_hash, observation_index),
  FOREIGN KEY (net, block_height, block_hash) REFERENCES blocks (net, height, block_hash)
) PARTITION BY RANGE (block_height)
```

Index: `bridge_observations_by_kind (kind)`. Partitioned by `RANGE (block_height)`, following the
same rollover shape as `blocks`/`transactions`.

### `verifier_key_observations`

Records **where and how** a verifier key (a content-addressed circuit artifact) has been observed,
as distinct from the key's own bytes (which live in `chain_blobs`, classified via the
`verifier_key` `chain_blob_roles` role — no separate content-keyed table is needed for that half).

```sql
CREATE TABLE verifier_key_observations (
  id                bigint      GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  vk_hash           bytea       NOT NULL REFERENCES chain_blobs(hash),
  net               text        NOT NULL,
  scope             text        NOT NULL CHECK (scope IN ('protocol', 'contract')),
  tag               text        NOT NULL,
  contract_address  bytea,
  first_seen_height bigint      NOT NULL CHECK (first_seen_height >= 0),
  synced_at         timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  CHECK ((scope = 'contract') = (contract_address IS NOT NULL)),
  UNIQUE NULLS NOT DISTINCT (vk_hash, net, scope, contract_address, tag)
);
CREATE INDEX verifier_key_observations_by_contract
  ON verifier_key_observations (contract_address) WHERE contract_address IS NOT NULL;
```

- **Why a separate observations table rather than one row per key hash**: reading the actual
  ledger/crypto source (`transient-crypto/src/proofs.rs`, `ledger/src/structure.rs`) confirmed a
  `VerifierKey`'s content-addressed bytes are a pure function of the compiled circuit, with no
  network/contract/address salt anywhere in serialization — so nothing stops two different contract
  addresses (the same circuit deployed twice) or two different networks from genuinely sharing
  byte-identical key content. A single-row-per-hash table cannot record more than one
  `(net, scope, contract_address)` context per key without either rejecting a real second sighting
  or overwriting the first one's context.
- `CHECK ((scope = 'contract') = (contract_address IS NOT NULL))` enforces the relationship in
  **both directions** — a protocol-scoped row with a non-null address, and a contract-scoped row
  with a null address, are both rejected.
- The uniqueness key is `UNIQUE NULLS NOT DISTINCT (vk_hash, net, scope, contract_address, tag)`
  (Postgres 15+ syntax): a surrogate `id` primary key is used instead of making that tuple the PK
  directly, because `contract_address` is legitimately `NULL` for protocol-scoped rows and
  Postgres requires every PK column to be `NOT NULL`. `NULLS NOT DISTINCT` (rather than ordinary
  `UNIQUE`, which treats every `NULL` as distinct from every other `NULL`) is what makes two
  *different* protocol-scoped observations of the same key (different `net`, both
  `contract_address IS NULL`) coexist as distinct rows while an exact duplicate context is
  correctly rejected.
- `tag` (naming the circuit/entry-point role a key was observed playing) **is part of the
  uniqueness key**; `first_seen_height` is **not** — it is a mutable "earliest known" fact about an
  observation context, maintained via `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (vk_hash, net, scope,
  contract_address, tag) DO UPDATE SET first_seen_height = LEAST(...)`, never a plain `INSERT`.
  Including `tag` fixes a real data-loss bug where two legitimate different-entry-point
  observations of the same key collided and one silently overwrote the other; excluding
  `first_seen_height` prevents the same logical identity being re-inserted under contradictory
  "first-seen" claims.

### `chain_archive.watermarks`

A **separate, independent** `watermarks` table living inside the `chain_archive` schema — not a
reuse of `tier1_wallet.watermarks`. Same shape and rationale (`fillfactor = 90` for HOT-friendly
high-frequency cursor writes) as the tier1 table, deliberately duplicated rather than
cross-referenced: reaching across the schema boundary to write into `tier1_wallet`'s table from
`chain_archive`'s independent lineage would re-couple the two tiers this split exists to keep
apart — a `chain_archive`-only deployment/backup/restore could no longer be self-contained.

```sql
CREATE TABLE watermarks (
  kind       text NOT NULL,
  key        text NOT NULL,
  value      jsonb NOT NULL,
  updated_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  PRIMARY KEY (kind, key)
) WITH (fillfactor = 90)
```

`ChainArchiveStore.setWatermark` additionally guards against **regression**: for the one real
convention this store's watermark values follow (`{ height: number }`, the sync cursor shape), the
upsert's `WHERE` clause only applies the update when the incoming `height` is strictly greater than
the stored one (or either side isn't shaped that way, in which case it falls back to unconditional
last-write-wins). This closes a race where two overlapping sync-service runs could otherwise let a
slower, stale call overwrite the cursor backward, which would make the next sync attempt re-process
already-ingested heights and hit a duplicate-key wedge.

### `runtime_metadata`

Migration 003 makes the archive self-describing for block-scoped decoding:

```sql
CREATE TABLE runtime_metadata (
  net                text        NOT NULL,
  spec_name          text        NOT NULL,
  spec_version       bigint      NOT NULL CHECK (spec_version >= 0),
  first_seen_height  bigint      NOT NULL CHECK (first_seen_height >= 0),
  metadata_blob_hash bytea       NOT NULL REFERENCES chain_blobs(hash),
  captured_at        timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  PRIMARY KEY (net, spec_name, spec_version)
)
```

The SCALE bytes are content-addressed with role `runtime_metadata`. Ingest first consults this
table, fetching historical `state_getMetadata` only for a runtime identity not yet captured.
Re-decode and replay can therefore operate without retaining the node response forever. First-time
ingest still needs an archive node for per-block events/state; metadata cannot replace values that
were never captured.

### `replay_checkpoints`

Migrations 004–006 create and complete sparse ledger checkpoints:

```sql
CREATE TABLE replay_checkpoints (
  net                text   NOT NULL,
  block_height       bigint NOT NULL CHECK (block_height >= 0),
  block_hash         bytea  NOT NULL CHECK (octet_length(block_hash) = 32),
  state_blob_hash    bytea  NOT NULL REFERENCES chain_blobs(hash),
  ledger_version     text   NOT NULL,
  block_timestamp_ms bigint NOT NULL CHECK (block_timestamp_ms > 0),
  ledger_network_id  text   NOT NULL CHECK (length(ledger_network_id) > 0),
  created_at         timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  PRIMARY KEY (net, block_height, block_hash),
  FOREIGN KEY (net, block_height, block_hash)
    REFERENCES blocks (net, height, block_hash)
)
```

`state_blob_hash` uses role `ledger_state`. The version refuses cross-build serialized-state
resume; the network id refuses cross-network resume; and the checkpointed timestamp supplies the
real parent time to the next block. Restart selects the newest finalized/canonical checkpoint at or
below the watermark and catches up consecutively, checking parent hashes and the node's committed
`midnight_ledgerStateRoot` at every block. Migrations 005/006 delete legacy derived checkpoints
instead of inventing missing time/network values. Migration 007 forward-fixes role-removal guards
for databases that already recorded the draft 003/004 bodies.

### Partition rollover design

**Why partitioning exists:** block height grows without bound for the lifetime of the network, and
`blocks`/`transactions`/`bridge_observations` are all partitioned `RANGE` on a height column for
exactly that reason — an unpartitioned table accumulating years of chain history would eventually
degrade every index and vacuum operation against it.

**Pre-created partitions, not an unbounded `DEFAULT`.** The migration itself
(`createHeightPartitions` in `001_chain_archive_core.ts`) creates
`CHAIN_ARCHIVE_PRECREATED_PARTITIONS` (currently **5**) bounded partitions of
`CHAIN_ARCHIVE_HEIGHT_PARTITION_SIZE` (currently **1,000,000**) heights each, starting at height 0,
plus one `DEFAULT` catch-all partition for any height beyond the pre-created range. Both constants
live in one place, `partition-config.ts`, specifically so the schema DDL and any documentation of
it cannot silently diverge. Five buckets (5,000,000 blocks of headroom) is intended to be enough
runway that, combined with a rollover job run well before the top bucket fills, the `DEFAULT`
partition should never receive a row in practice on a healthy deployment — a single `DEFAULT`
partition silently accumulating unbounded overflow is a real operational hazard, since reorganizing
it later requires a heavyweight, locking procedure.

**The rollover runbook, as implemented (`src/postgres/chain-archive-rollover.ts`,
`rolloverDefaultPartition`)**, handles the common case where a table's overflowed `DEFAULT`
partition's rows fit entirely inside one new bounded bucket `[lo, hi)` (true whenever rollover is
triggered before monitoring lags by more than one bucket width). It refuses to proceed — rather
than silently mis-routing data — if any row in a table's `DEFAULT` partition falls outside the
target bucket; a `DEFAULT` spanning multiple buckets needs a documented multi-bucket split fallback
that is explicitly out of scope for this automated helper. The steps, all inside one transaction on
a single reserved connection:

1. **Detach children before the parent.** `transactions`/`bridge_observations`' `DEFAULT`
   partitions are detached first; only then is `blocks`' `DEFAULT` partition detached — detaching
   the parent first is rejected while the FK-bearing children are still attached.
2. **Drop the retained FK constraint** on each detached child (Postgres retains a detached
   partition's FK constraint; it must be dropped before the rename/reattach below). FK constraint
   names are looked up dynamically from `pg_constraint`/`pg_class` rather than hardcoded, so the
   function stays correct against whatever names the real migration actually generated.
3. **Rename** each detached table out of the way (`*_default` → `*_default_staging`) to free the
   `*_default` name for a fresh, empty `DEFAULT` partition later.
4. **Reattach the staging data** as a correctly-bounded partition (`ALTER TABLE ... ATTACH
   PARTITION ... FOR VALUES FROM (lo) TO (hi)`) — **before** recreating `DEFAULT` or resuming
   writers. This ordering (not "recreate `DEFAULT` immediately") is what closes a write-race window
   where a live write could otherwise land in the gap between detach and reattach.
5. **Recreate empty `DEFAULT` partitions** on all three tables, only after step 4 completes.
6. Resume writers — the caller's own responsibility; this function does not manage pausing/resuming
   writers itself (the design's documented guidance is to hold the same schema-scoped advisory lock
   `migrate.ts`'s `runMigrations` already uses, if a caller wants that coordination).

The function is idempotent for a *repeated* invocation with the same `(suffix, lo, hi)`: it checks
the catalog up front (`rolloverAlreadyApplied`) and short-circuits to a no-op if that exact rollover
already fully succeeded, and throws (refusing to guess) if a prior attempt left the suffix only
*partially* applied. Every query it issues — the idempotency check, pre-flight span checks, FK
lookups, and the DDL itself — runs on one reserved connection (not the general pool), both so the
FK lookups see this same transaction's own uncommitted `DETACH` and so the function cannot
self-deadlock waiting for a pool connection it is itself holding under a `maxConnections: 1`
configuration.

**`ChainArchiveStore` (`src/postgres/chain-archive-store.ts`) implementation notes:**

- Every write path (`putBlock`, `putTransactions`, `putBridgeObservations`,
  `putVerifierKeyObservation`) is idempotent against a byte-for-byte-identical re-ingest of the
  same key: every terminal `INSERT` uses `ON CONFLICT ... DO NOTHING` (or, for verifier-key
  observations, `DO UPDATE SET first_seen_height = LEAST(...)`) on the table's own primary/unique
  key, so retrying an ingest that already durably committed is a safe no-op, not a duplicate-key
  error. This does not replace the need for a watermark — callers driving an at-least-once sync
  loop still must track "last successfully ingested height" — but it removes the specific failure
  mode where retrying the same height after a partial or already-committed prior attempt would
  otherwise wedge permanently.
- `putBlockBundle` composes the block row plus all of its transactions and bridge observations into
  **one** transaction, so a partial block (e.g. the `blocks` row committed but its transactions
  not, because an interrupted write or an inconsistent upstream source) can never become durably
  visible. Insert order within that transaction (block row first) matters: it makes the block
  visible to the later FK-checked inserts via ordinary same-transaction MVCC visibility, even
  though the block row hasn't committed yet.
  Before comparison or insertion it takes a transaction-scoped Postgres advisory lock derived from
  `(net,height)`, then refuses a different finalized canonical block and rechecks existing
  `(position,tx_hash,kind)` triples under the lock. Identical retries agree idempotently; competing
  histories refuse. The guard is database-wide across processes, not a JavaScript mutex. This
  bundle path is the finalized-only production writer contract.
- `getBlob` always **rehashes on read** and rejects (`BlobIntegrityError`) if the recomputed SHA-256
  disagrees with the lookup key — it never returns bytes it cannot verify, mirroring
  `CheckpointStore.load`'s proven chunk-integrity pattern in the tier1_wallet lineage.
- `setCanonical` flips canonical status at `(net, height)` atomically: it un-marks whichever block
  currently holds the canonical slot (if any, and if different) and marks the target block
  canonical, both inside one transaction — so a concurrent reader can only ever observe
  zero-then-new-canonical or old-then-new-canonical, never two canonical rows at once. This ordering
  is required by `blocks_one_canonical_per_height`'s partial unique index, which permits at most one
  `is_canonical = true` row per `(net, height)` at every instant, not just at transaction end.

---

## How the two lineages coexist

Both lineages share the runner in `src/postgres/migrate.ts`, but each applies to its **own**
schema and its own `_migrations` bookkeeping table — never a merged schema. `runMigrations` was
extended (not rewritten) with one new option to support a second lineage:

```ts
export interface RunMigrationsOptions {
  schema: string;
  /** Which migration lineage to apply. Defaults to `tier1WalletMigrations` — every existing
   *  caller that doesn't pass this continues to get exactly the migrations it always did. */
  migrations?: Migration[];
}
```

- Every existing tier1_wallet caller that omits `migrations` is unaffected — `tier1WalletMigrations`
  (the array `[migration000, migration001, migration002, migration003, migration004, migration005, migration006]`, formerly the
  module's unexported default) remains the implicit default.
- A `chain_archive` caller passes `{ schema: "chain_archive", migrations: chainArchiveMigrations }`
  explicitly. `chainArchiveMigrations` (`migrations/chain_archive/index.ts`) is
  `[migration000, chainArchiveCore, transactionPositionKey, runtimeMetadata, replayCheckpoints,
  replayCheckpointBlockTime, replayCheckpointLedgerNetwork, blobRoleGuardForwardFix]` — it
  **reuses `000_schema.ts` unchanged**: that migration's
  `up(sql, schema)` was already fully schema-parameterized (`CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS <schema>`
  plus a `<schema>._migrations` table scoped to whatever `schema` string is passed in), so running
  it a second time against a *different* schema name bootstraps a second, independent
  `_migrations` table with no collision — the same migration `name` ("000_schema") appearing in two
  different schemas' `_migrations` tables is not a collision, since each is a distinct,
  schema-qualified physical table.
- `runMigrationsImpl` reads its bootstrap migration off `lineage[0]` rather than a hardcoded
  `migration000` reference, so a future third lineage that didn't happen to start with a
  schema-bootstrap migration would surface as a real bug (a missing `_migrations` table) instead of
  a mismatched hardcoded reference silently running the wrong thing.
- `chain-archive-sync/bootstrap.ts` is the production call site. The packaged archive-sync CLI
  invokes it before constructing the service, so a fresh database reaches the complete lineage
  before ingest begins.

Both schemas can coexist in one Postgres instance because the migration runner's advisory lock
(class `1`, keyed by `hashtext(schema)`) is per-schema — two different schemas' migrations run
under different lock keys and can proceed concurrently without interfering, while two concurrent
callers migrating the *same* schema are correctly serialized.

## Boundary enforcement

Two automated, repo-wide guard tests keep the architectural rule — `src/postgres/*` (and
`src/interfaces/*`) must stay free of the Midnight wallet SDK and free of any chain-sync/indexer
dependency — actually enforced rather than just documented:

- **`test/postgres/no-sdk-import-guard.test.ts`** (tier1_wallet's guard) walks every `.ts` file
  under `src/` recursively and asserts none of them contain the substring `@midnightntwrk` anywhere
  in their source text — not a per-line `/^\s*import\b/` filter (an earlier version of this guard
  used exactly that filter and was found, by audit, to miss a **re-export** shape:
  `export { x } from "@midnightntwrk/y"` references the SDK at runtime exactly as much as an
  `import` does, but its line starts with `export`, not `import`, so the old line-filtered check
  silently passed a file containing only re-exports). The current whole-file substring scan has no
  such blind spot; the test file includes a fixture proving the old filter would have missed the
  exact case the new check catches.
- **`test/postgres/no-chain-sync-import-guard.test.ts`** (chain_archive's guard, on the branch
  where that schema lives) similarly ensures the real ingestion/sync implementation — the node-RPC
  and indexer-GraphQL client code, `chain-archive-sync/*` — lives entirely **outside** `src/`
  altogether (the strongest form of the boundary rule: not just outside `src/postgres/`, outside
  `src/` in its entirety). It checks three independent things for every `.ts` file under `src/`:
  (a) string-literal `from`/`import(...)` specifiers referencing the `chain-archive-sync` path
  segment; (b) any string literal (single-, double-, or backtick-quoted) containing the substring
  `chain-archive-sync`, extracted by a real string-aware scanner that correctly skips `//` and
  block comments (so a doc comment that legitimately *names* the directory does not false-positive)
  — catching `require(...)`/computed-`import()` shapes a naive regex would miss; and (c) the
  ingestion layer's distinguishing exported class names (`NodeRpcClient`, `IndexerClient`,
  `ChainArchiveSyncService`) appearing anywhere in the file, catching a re-export or a copy under a
  different path. The test file documents its own residual, statically-undetectable gaps (a
  specifier assembled from split string literals, an import routed through an external barrel file
  outside `src/`, a fully runtime-constructed specifier) rather than claiming complete coverage.

Both guards run as ordinary Vitest tests — a violation fails the test suite, not just a lint pass
that could be silently skipped.
