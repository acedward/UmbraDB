# UmbraDB 1.0.0 Release Contracts

The written, checkable contracts that govern the frozen 1.0.0 surface. Each section states a
guarantee (or a binding precondition/limitation) that is **true of the code as shipped** — none of
these is aspirational. The SemVer stability policy is [`docs/STABILITY.md`](STABILITY.md); the frozen
error-code catalog is [`docs/ERROR-CATALOG.md`](ERROR-CATALOG.md).

## 1. Durability contract

**Ordering guarantee.** The durable sync **cursor** (a watermark) is never ahead of the durable
checkpoint **data** it references. A cursor ahead of its data is the silent-skip failure (on resume
the sync believes it persisted data a crash actually lost, and never re-fetches it); a cursor behind
its data is the safe, recoverable direction (on resume the sync re-applies a bounded window of
already-durable writes and converges). The G5 co-transactional `save` fix establishes this: persist
the checkpoint and advance the cursor **in one transaction** — use `saveAndAdvance`, or pass one
shared `opts.tx` to both `CheckpointStore.save` and `Watermarks.set`, so both become durable at the
same commit or neither does. The full composition contract (both conforming compositions and the
invariant) is [`docs/checkpoint-store-contract.md`](checkpoint-store-contract.md).

**Binding Postgres precondition.** "Durable" only means something when the server is configured for
crash safety. UmbraDB requires, as a **binding deployer precondition**:

- `fsync = on`,
- `full_page_writes = on`,
- `synchronous_commit` = one of `on` / `local` / `remote_write` / `remote_apply` (i.e. not `off`),
- **no transaction pooler** — connect UmbraDB directly to PostgreSQL, or use a **session-mode** pool
  (a transaction-pooling proxy silently breaks the session advisory locks the writer lease relies
  on).

**Probe precondition.** These are enforced at startup by the durability probe
(`src/postgres/durability-probe.ts`), which runs as a **mandatory step of `runMigrations`, before
any migration runs**: `fsync = off` or `full_page_writes = off` makes `runMigrations` **reject** with
`DurabilityContractError` (full-page-writes-off is overridable only with an external torn-page
guarantee); a detected transaction pooler makes it **reject** with `TransactionPoolerDetectedError`;
`synchronous_commit = off` raises a typed lost-tail **warning** rather than refusing. The one exception
to the `fsync` rule is a PGlite client in its non-durable mode, accepted only on a PGlite server
(`docs/durability-contract.md` §1a); PostgreSQL always refuses `fsync = off`. The full
configuration contract, including session-mode pooler setup and the applied server-side timeouts, is
[`docs/durability-contract.md`](durability-contract.md).

## 2. Forward-only / no-downgrade migration contract

Migrations are **forward-only**. `src/postgres/migrate.ts`'s `Migration` interface is deliberately
`up()`-only — there is **no `down()` / rollback path**. Consequences, which are binding:

- A new UmbraDB **major** MAY require running a documented forward migration (`runMigrations`)
  against an existing database before it will operate.
- There is **no supported downgrade**: a database migrated to a newer major cannot be migrated back
  to an older UmbraDB major. Take a backup before a major upgrade (§6) if you need a rollback option.
- On an **application rollback** (redeploying older application code without touching the database),
  the schema-version bookkeeping row (`<schema>._migrations`) already records the newer schema
  version; the older application runs against the already-migrated schema. Only run an older app
  major against a schema its own major understands.

The generated schema reference is [`docs/SCHEMA.md`](SCHEMA.md).

## 3. Cancellation semantics

The read and write operations accept an `AbortSignal` (`opts.signal`) and pre-check it; a few
signal-less methods are the exceptions -- notably `TransactionLeaseLayer.releaseLease(lease)`,
which takes no `opts` and threads no signal (release is the always-run cleanup half of a lease and
must not be cancellable out from under a still-held advisory lock). Where a signal IS accepted, the
guarantee, as public contract, depends on **when** the abort lands (three timings):

- **Before dispatch** (an already-aborted signal) — **no query is issued**; the call rejects
  immediately without touching the backend.
- **During a long read** (`listKeys`, lease acquisition) — the in-flight cursor / lock wait is
  **freed**: the driver's `query.cancel()` fires and the wait unwinds, rather than running to
  completion.
- **During a quick write** — the write **may still complete**. Abort is best-effort for a
  short-lived statement already in flight; a caller must not assume a mid-write abort prevented the
  write (re-read to determine the actual state).

## 4. Save-retry caveat

`CheckpointStore.save` is **not blindly retryable**. The default `save()` (no caller-supplied
`opts.tx`) runs in its own `withTransaction` (`src/postgres/checkpoint-store.ts`), so a connection
lost around its `COMMIT` -- including the case where the commit outcome is **uncertain** because the
`COMMIT` acknowledgement itself was lost -- surfaces as a **retryable** `TransactionFaultError` with
`faultKind: "connection-lost"` (`src/postgres/transaction-lease.ts`), **not** a `ConnectionError`.
(`ConnectionError` is what a consumer sees on the **non-transactional** paths -- a connection failure
outside a `withTransaction`.) On that `TransactionFaultError("connection-lost")` a caller MUST
**re-check `history()` before retrying** `save`, because the commit may or may not have landed: a
blind retry of an actually-committed save produces a benign identical-content duplicate at the next
sequence, which `retainCount` prunes -- but the re-check is the documented rule so a caller never
assumes the first attempt was lost. (Consistent with the recovery-testing C1 reconciliation, which
fixed the same code-vs-doc mismatch for the crash tests.)

Automatic idempotency (an `idempotency_key` `UNIQUE` constraint that would make the retry a no-op
without the `history()` re-check) is a **deferred additive 1.1 migration**, not a 1.0 code change. No
idempotency code ships in 1.0.

**Retryability caveat -- a persistent `28xxx` auth/config failure surfaces as a retryable
`ConnectionError`.** An authentication failure (SQLSTATE `28000`/`28P01` -- a rejected credential or
role) is translated to `ConnectionError`, which is marked **retryable**. A transient authorization
hiccup can clear on retry, but a *persistent* wrong-credential / revoked-role / misconfiguration
failure will **not** clear without a deployment change, so a caller MUST **bound its retries** of a
retryable `ConnectionError` rather than retry indefinitely. A distinct non-retryable
`AuthenticationError` code is a candidate for an **additive 1.1 minor** (adding a new error code is
non-breaking per [`docs/STABILITY.md`](STABILITY.md)); it is deliberately outside the frozen 1.0
surface. See [`docs/ERROR-CATALOG.md`](ERROR-CATALOG.md) for the full rationale.

## 5. Lease limitation

The writer lease (`acquireLease` / `withLease`, connection-pinned Postgres advisory locks) guards
concurrent acquirers **only within the documented single-process deployment model**. Specifically:

- It does **not fence writes against connection death**: a lease is a session advisory lock, not a
  fencing token, so a paused/partitioned holder whose connection later resumes is not fenced off by a
  monotonic token.
- **Do not run two writer processes.** UmbraDB is designed for a single writer against a single
  Postgres instance; running two writer processes is unsupported in the 1.0 model.

Pinned-connection fencing is a 1.0.x / 1.1 consideration, not a 1.0 guarantee.

## 6. Backup/restore guidance

Back up an UmbraDB schema with a **consistent** dump — `pg_dump` takes a snapshot-consistent dump by
default (a single transaction / consistent snapshot), which is what UmbraDB requires:

```bash
pg_dump --format=custom --schema='my_app' "$DATABASE_URL" > umbradb-my_app.dump
```

- **Chunk/manifest consistency.** `CheckpointStore` is content-addressed: manifests reference chunks
  by content hash across separate tables. Dump the schema **as one consistent unit** (the default
  single-snapshot `pg_dump` above does this) so every manifest's referenced chunks are captured
  together — never dump the chunk tables and manifest tables in separate, independently-timed passes.
- **A mid-GC dump is safe to restore.** Garbage collection is a two-step manifest-prune-then-chunk-
  reclaim pass, and reads run under `REPEATABLE READ`. A single-snapshot `pg_dump` taken **during** a
  GC pass captures one consistent point-in-time: it never sees a manifest whose chunks were already
  reclaimed. The restored schema is therefore internally consistent.

Restore with `pg_restore` into a database at the **same** UmbraDB major (see §2 — there is no
supported downgrade across a major).

## 7. Threat-model pointer

The UmbraDB threat model is authored separately as `SECURITY.md` (gate G15, the InfoSec change) and
is **not** authored by this contract set. It covers: a single trusted writer; the schema is **not** a
security boundary; the global content-addressed chunk pool is one trust domain with an observable
dedup side channel; and no at-rest encryption (a binding deployer precondition). This section is the
reserved pointer so the contract set is complete.

> **See:** [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) _(authored by the G15 InfoSec change)._

## 8. Format headroom (reserved for 1.1)

The **wallet-state envelope** encoding is **versioned**: the envelope carries an explicit
`ENVELOPE_VERSION` field (`src/interfaces/wallet-state-envelope.ts`), so a v2 envelope format can be
introduced additively.

**Chunk content-addressing is NOT versioned in 1.0.** Chunks are addressed by a hard-coded SHA-256
over their bytes (`src/postgres/checkpoint-store.ts`), and the schema stores bare, unversioned
manifest/chunk hashes (`src/postgres/migrations/002_checkpoint_store.ts`: `ckpt_chunks.hash` and
`ckpt_manifests.manifest_hash` are plain `bytea`, with no algorithm/version column). A future
keyed/encrypted or alternate-hash chunk mode (which would also close the dedup-oracle side channel
of section 7) therefore requires an **additive migration adding a hash-algorithm/version field**,
reserved for **1.1**. Such a migration is additive (a new column defaulting to the current SHA-256
mode), so it is not a breaking change -- but 1.0 ships **no** such field and **no** keyed-chunking or
encryption code. This is honest headroom, not a claim that chunk addressing is already versioned.
